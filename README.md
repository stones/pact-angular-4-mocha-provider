# Pact Angular 4 mocha provider example

> This is a very, very basic example of pact provider tests.

## Quickstart

```
composer install
npm i
npm start
```

Then in another terminal window:
```
npm run test:pact
```
If you want an example of using pacts from pact broker, update the `scripts/pact.broker.spec.js`. Then run `npm run test:pact:broker`.

## Why
I created a [repo demonstrating implementing pact with angular 4 and mocha](https://github.com/stones/pact-angular-4-mocha). This is the repository for that provider api repository. It is possibly the simplest example I could come up with.
